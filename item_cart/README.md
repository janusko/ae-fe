*Your HTML code should use a table with proper semantic markup and with Item Cart as its caption.
  1. Items: Banana, Burger, Cookie and a Total
  2. Price: $1.00, $6.90, $4.20, and total of $12.10
  3. Quantity: 3, 1, 4, and total of 8.


*You only need to write the HTML that would go inside of a document's body tag; no need to worry about the head tag, the html tag, or the !DOCTYPE declaration.
