* You've been provided with a blog post as raw text, and you need to convert this post into a properly marked-up HTML file.
* The post should have a primary heading of "Introducing AlgoCoin" with a tagline of "The future of decentralized meme currency is here."
* The post should be treated as an article with two sections, titled "What is AlgoCoin" and "Where Do I Start?", respectively. Each section should have a paragraph of text (the text directly below the respective section in the starting code), and the sections should be divided by a horizontal rule.
* In the first section, the text "proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm" should be marked up as strong text, and the Web 4.0 should be emphasized. In the section, the world "AlgoExpert" should be a link to https://algoexpert.io, and it should open in a new tab.
* Finally, the post should have a footer at the bottom with the text "Copyright 3022 AlgoCoin. All rights reserved."

* Your HTML code should use proper semantic markup. However, you only need to write the HTML that would go inside of a document's body tag; no need to worry about the head tag, the html tag, or the !DOCTYPE declaration.
